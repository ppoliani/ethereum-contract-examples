# Adding ethereum toolset to your machine

   - We can either follow the instuctions here https://ethereum.org/cli OR
   - If we decide to install the Mist (Ethereum Wallet) then we can use the **geth** binary that comes with it. Inorder to make it available in the terminal we should add it to the $PATH

   ```
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Ethereum\ Wallet/binaries/Geth/unpacked
   ```
